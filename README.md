# pkgbuilds

Collection of `pkgbuild` scripts for the [Arch build system](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_build_system).

### Usage

Save the `pkgbuild` to your working directory, and run:

```sh
makepkg -i
```

---

<!-- None of are on the [`AUR`](https://aur.archlinux.org/) (at least yet). -->

Storing the `pkgbuild` in the project repo necessitates an additional commit after each new release to update the `sha256sums`. Hopefully this will keep things tidy.
